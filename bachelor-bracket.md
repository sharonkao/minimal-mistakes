## Rules / Legal Fine Print
1. Rank the guys or girls in order of *WHEN THEY WILL LEAVE* the show (1 = out in the first episode).
2. Submissions are due before the first airing of the second episode.
3. No researching/cheating with spoilers until after you submit your picks. Your only "tools" can be your sheer matchmaking prowess, the first episode of the show, and/or the contest bios on [the ABC website](http://abc.com).  We're putting our trust in y'all, so scout's honor everyone. 
4. $10 entries can be paid by cash / check / venmo / paypal / square / google wallet.  If you need another payment arrangement, let me know and we'll figure something out.
5. If you have any folks who want to participate in the bracket, it's not too late!  Just forward them the this email and have them submit their picks through the link before the deadline. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
6. Other questions? Just email me.
