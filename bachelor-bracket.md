## Rules / Legal Fine Print
1. Rank the guys/girls from top to bottom in the order of *HOW LONG THEY WILL STAY* in the show (Top = wins the FINAL rose).
2. Submissions are due before the first airing of the second episode.
3. No researching/cheating with spoilers until after you submit your picks. Your only "tools" can be your sheer matchmaking prowess, the first episode of the show, and/or the contest bios on [the ABC website](http://abc.com).  We're putting our trust in y'all, so scout's honor everyone. 
4. Along with submitting your picks, also need to submit a $10 (USD) entry fee.  This can be paid by cash, venmo, paypal, square, google wallet, wechat, and/or alipay to me.  If you need another payment arrangement, let me know and we'll figure something out.
5. Prizes: 1st place (~70% of pot), 2nd place (~20% of pot), 3rd place (~10% of pot), and last place (half entry fee returned)
6. Other questions? Just email me.
